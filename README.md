Welcome to Let's Go To, an app to record the places you want to, or have been and share your thought with other users

Built with Sinatra and ActiveRecord.

# Installation
Clone down this repo.
Run bundler install to grab all the required dependancies.
Run Rake:db migrate to build the relevent databases
Run Shotgun to run it locally.

# Usage
The App will allow you to signup as a new user, login and logout. 
Once you are signed in, you can create a new Attraction, specifying its name, location, comments, and whever you have been there before.
All users can view all attractions but you need to have created an attraction to then be able to edit or delete it.
